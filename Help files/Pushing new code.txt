That's great news! Congratulations on getting your website online.

Now that everything is set up, the process for making edits is very straightforward and follows a standard workflow for modern web development.

You will make your code changes on your local computer and then push those changes to your GitHub repository. Render will automatically detect the new changes and deploy them.

The Workflow for Making Edits:
Step 1: Make Your Code Changes
Using your preferred text editor (like VS Code), make all the changes you want to your website's files (app.py, files in the templates folder, users.json, etc.) on your local machine.

Step 2: Commit the Changes
After you have saved all your changes, open your terminal or command prompt in your project folder. You need to tell Git which files you want to save.

Stage your changes:

Bash

git add .
This command adds all the changed files to a "staging area" for the next commit.

Commit the changes:

Bash

git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
Replace "Your descriptive commit message" with a short, clear description of what you changed (e.g., "Fixed a bug on the login page" or "Added a new feature").

Step 3: Push the Changes to GitHub
This is the final step where you upload your committed changes to your GitHub repository.

Bash

git push origin main
This command sends all of your local commits to the main branch of your remote repository on GitHub.

Render's Automation
Once Render detects that new changes have been pushed to your GitHub repository, it will automatically start a new deployment. You can see this happening on your Render dashboard. It will:

Pull the latest code.

Rebuild your Docker image with the new files.

Deploy the updated container.

Your website will then automatically be updated with your changes, usually within a few minutes.
